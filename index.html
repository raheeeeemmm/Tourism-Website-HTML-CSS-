        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The Tourism</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours. The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes". Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Importance of Tourism</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The tourism industry, as part of the service sector has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries. The Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their international relations. Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists, accounting as of 2011 for 30% of the world's trade in services, and, as an invisible export, for 6% of overall exports of goods and services. It also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism. It is also claimed that travel broadens the mind." </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Tourism Growth</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">"The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4%.With the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become prominent traded items on the internet.Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.It has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context.Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future." </p>
